# 📚 Smart Study Planner

### 🎯 Object-Oriented Python Application for Task & Study Management

Smart Study Planner is a **UML-driven**, modular Python project designed with advanced **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Design Patterns**.
It allows users to create, organize, and track study tasks efficiently using structured classes like **Task**, **User**, and **Planner**.

---

## 🧩 Features

* 🧠 **OOP Design:** Encapsulation, Aggregation, and Composition applied in class design
* 📋 **Task Management:** Create, filter, sort, and track study tasks
* 📊 **Statistics:** View completion rate and performance summary
* ⚙️ **Design Pattern Ready:** Built to integrate Strategy, Observer, and Singleton patterns
* 🧱 **Modular Architecture:** Scalable codebase structured into packages (core, data, ui, etc.)
