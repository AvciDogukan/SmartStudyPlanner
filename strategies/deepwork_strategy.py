Deep Work Strategy Module
=========================

This module implements the `DeepWorkStrategy` class â€” a concrete implementation
of the `StudyStrategy` interface. It is inspired by Cal Newportâ€™s *Deep Work*
principles: long, uninterrupted sessions of focused work followed by longer breaks.

Created:

Notes:
------
- Inherits from `StudyStrategy` (defined in `strategy_base.py`)
- Designed for tasks requiring high concentration and cognitive depth
- Can be dynamically injected into the Planner class
